# Linear_Regression
Linear Regression is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points.

A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error, or the distance from each point to the line.

A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of best fit.
